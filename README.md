# ESP32
An educational algorithm that teaches you how to use the ESP32 chip with the features of this piece and the software you need
1-The first step in programming is to download a program"
Arduino IDE"
2-Choose the right operating system, device, and bit
3-just download
4-Connect the ESP32 piece to the port5- From the File menu bar

6-Example"This list contains examples of most of the programming cases of the widget"
You can choose the example you want to give and you will see the code ready

7- Then we will go to"Blink"
Before installing the controller, we must make this code for the blink, and the reason is to make sure that the piece is ready for programming

The presence of the bulb in this piece is specially made for these experiments
Ensure that the piece is ready for programming "bulb for test"

8-The code is a season of two parts 
    1-setup
    "We write the things we write once"
    2-loop 
   "The repetitive part that gives me time to work"
9-This is the code to turn on the lamp

Void setup(){
pinMode(LED_BUILLTIN,OUTPUT);

}

Void loop(){
digitalwrite( LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
delay(1000);
digitalwrite( LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
delay(1000);




}
Note
The number is 1000, you can change it, and it will show the seconds in which the lamp works, or to count how long it is turned off

HIGH
Here is the light

LOW
Off the light

10 - The features of this piece are many
- What is special about it is that it has WiFi and Bluetooth
- Software can be downloaded
- You can control it from your phone or computer
- You can control anything that runs on electricity through it
- Bluetooth 4.2
- And the negative GND output is a 3.3V voltage output
-Consists of 18 digital outputs These outputs allow you to output two energies 0 volts or 5 volts
- It has a connection to connect it to the computer
- Competitive price on features
- powerful processor<img width="416" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108140215/178851727-85de7519-899f-4c0b-8d0b-4c90968fcd23.png">
